<a class=heading-link href=#who-is-thomas-johander><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true></i></a></h2><p>I&rsquo;ve had the title &ldquo;Engineer&rdquo; during most of my professional life. It has never really fit, though. &ldquo;Explorer&rdquo; rings much more true if I was to describe my relationship to technology. From my first experiences as a kid staring at the inky black depths of an MS-DOS command prompt, to my attempts at making enterprise software function inside a figurative jungle of apis, data and protocols, I&rsquo;ve always been most fascinated with answering the question &ldquo;I wonder if I can&mldr;.&rdquo;.</p><h2 id=why-i-created-this-blog>Why I Created This Blog
<a class=heading-link href=#why-i-created-this-blog><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true></i></a></h2><p>The feeling of seeing bits go from point A to point B because I put the necessary pieces together is something I find thrilling and deeply satisfying. I consider myself very fortunate to have discovered that part of my character. It&rsquo;s that same thrill that&rsquo;s motivated me to share my discoveries to you.
I came to coding by way of an amazing <a href=https://www.primeacademy.io/>full-stack Javascript bootcamp</a>. To say this experience had a positive impact on my personal and professional life would be a major understatement. I wanted a place where I could think out loud, experiment with technology and share the lessons I learned with the hopes that someone else will benefit from my efforts. Selfishly, I also find that documenting things I learn helps me understand the lessons so much better. I gain so much more understanding if I have to break things down into understandable pieces.</p></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container></section></footer></main><script src=/js/coder.min.f453d26c79f010446cf0d9770197f77de32c07b7a5512d141a286247fe154a22.js integrity="sha256-9FPSbHnwEERs8Nl3AZf3feMsB7elUS0UGihiR/4VSiI="></script></body></html>
