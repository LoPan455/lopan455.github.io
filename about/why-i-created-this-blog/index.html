<a class=heading-link href=#why-i-created-this-blog><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true></i></a></h2><p>I came to coding by way of a (amazing) Full Stack Javascript Bootcamp. I had exposure to exactly 1 element in the above list during my software engineer training: MongoDB.
Everything that I&rsquo;ve learned about my current tech-stack has been on-the-job and just enough to finish the task at hand. I wanted to create a place where I could tinker, explore, learn and <em>have fun doing it</em>.
Teaching something is the highest form of understanding and this blog provides a place that I get to teach what I want.</p><h2 id=how-did-i-get-here>How Did I Get Here?
<a class=heading-link href=#how-did-i-get-here><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true></i></a></h2><p>I&rsquo;ve been a software developer for several years, but my career in Tech didn&rsquo;t start that way.</p><p>After working as a technical staff member at a Managed Services consultancy for several years, I really enjoyed what I did everyday.<br>Managing customers&rsquo; desktop support needs, some &ldquo;beginner&rdquo; Windows Server administration duties and the general grab-bag of random things that come across one&rsquo;s desk as Desktop Support agent,
I loved learning new things and mastering these machines that I found so fascinating.</p><p>The company I worked for allowed me to grow into larger roles and greater responsibilities. I worked with our Sales Engineering team conducting demos and road-show presentation for some cool IP the company had developed intgrating
Microsoft Business Productivity tools like SharePoint and Dynamics CRM with a contact center platform built by Interactive Intelligence (now part of the Genesys).
It was a period of my career that was exciting, stressful and challenging.</p><p>As time went on, though, I started to get antsy to expand my horizons. For every Telephony Engineer opening I could find, there would be ten software developer openings.<br>I thought that maybe I should allow myself to consider taking the plunge into developing the software that I had been merely operating for years.</p><p>I never thought I could be developer; phrases like this would always immediately follow thinking about learning to build software:</p><ul><li><em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Terrible at math&mldr;&rdquo;</em></li><li><em>&ldquo;I was never good at science&mldr;&rdquo;</em></li><li><em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be terrible at this and probably hate it&mldr;&rdquo;</em></li></ul><p>Faced with becoming more and more specialized in a role that would really limit my future options, I got to work.</p><p>I spent months weighing out the best way to re-tool my career into Software Engineering and decided to enroll in a
full-stack software engineering bootcamp program. After several months of very hard work, I graduated and landed
my first developer role working on a marketing platform run on the LAMP Stack with an AngularJS front-end.</p><p>Thanks to a lot of guidance and support from my team I took my first steps into Object Oriented Programming,
DevOps, Version Control Systems. It was hard work; sometimes exciting and energizing, other times confusing frustrating.
It was the perfect first developer job, though.</p></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container></section></footer></main><script src=/js/coder.min.f453d26c79f010446cf0d9770197f77de32c07b7a5512d141a286247fe154a22.js integrity="sha256-9FPSbHnwEERs8Nl3AZf3feMsB7elUS0UGihiR/4VSiI="></script></body></html>
