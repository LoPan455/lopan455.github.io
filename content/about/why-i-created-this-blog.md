## Who Is Thomas Johander?
     
I've had the title "Engineer" during most of my professional life.  It has never really fit, though.  "Explorer" rings much more true if I was to describe my relationship to technology. From my first experiences as a kid staring at the inky black depths of an MS-DOS command prompt, to my attempts at making enterprise software function inside a figurative jungle of apis, data and protocols, I've always been most fascinated with answering the question "I wonder if I can....".     

## Why I Created This Blog
The feeling of seeing bits go from point A to point B because I put the necessary pieces together is something I find thrilling and deeply satisfying.  I consider myself very fortunate to have discovered that part of my character.  It's that same thrill that's motivated me to share my discoveries to you.
I came to coding by way of an amazing [full-stack Javascript bootcamp](https://www.primeacademy.io/).  To say this experience had a positive impact on my personal and professional life would be a major understatement.  I wanted a place where I could think out loud, experiment with technology and share the lessons I learned with the hopes that someone else will benefit from my efforts.  Selfishly, I also find that documenting things I learn helps me understand the lessons so much better.  I gain so much more understanding if I have to break things down into understandable pieces.
