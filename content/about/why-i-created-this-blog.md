## Who Is Thomas Johander?

I'm a software engineer working in a large, Fortune 50 enterprise.  I work on a team that maintains an ever-growing portfolio of mircoservices, mostly REST APIs.   

The tech stack I work with day-to-day includes:
* Spring Boot
* Kotlin
* Groovy
* Spock Testing Framework
* Gradle
* Spring Web Flux
* MongoDB
* Kafka
* Elasticsearch


## Why I Created This Blog

I came to coding by way of a (amazing) Full Stack Javascript Bootcamp.  I had exposure to exactly 1 element in the above list during my software engineer training: MongoDB. 
Everything that I've learned about my current tech-stack has been on-the-job and just enough to finish the task at hand.  I wanted to create a place where I could tinker, explore, learn and _have fun doing it_.
Teaching something is the highest form of understanding and this blog provides a place that I get to teach what I want.

## How Did I Get Here?

I've been a software developer for several years, but my career in Tech didn't start that way.

After working as a technical staff member at a Managed Services consultancy for several years, I really enjoyed what I did everyday.  
Managing customers' desktop support needs, some "beginner" Windows Server administration duties and the general grab-bag of random things that come across one's desk as Desktop Support agent,
I loved learning new things and mastering these machines that I found so fascinating.

The company I worked for allowed me to grow into larger roles and greater responsibilities. I worked with our Sales Engineering team conducting demos and  road-show presentation for some cool IP the company had developed intgrating
Microsoft Business Productivity tools like SharePoint and Dynamics CRM with a contact center platform built by Interactive Intelligence (now part of the Genesys).
It was a period of my career that was exciting, stressful and challenging.

As time went on, though, I started to get antsy to expand my horizons.  For every Telephony Engineer opening I could find, there would be ten software developer openings.  
I thought that maybe I should allow myself to consider taking the plunge into developing the software that I had been merely operating for years.

I never thought I could be developer; phrases like this would always immediately follow thinking about learning to build software:

* _"I'm Terrible at math..."_
* _"I was never good at science..."_
* _"I'll be terrible at this and probably hate it..."_

Faced with becoming more and more specialized in a role that would really limit my future options, I got to work.

I spent months weighing out the best way to re-tool my career into Software Engineering and decided to enroll in a
full-stack software engineering bootcamp program.  After several months of very hard work, I graduated and landed
my first developer role working on a marketing platform run on the LAMP Stack with an AngularJS front-end.

Thanks to a lot of guidance and support from my team I took my first steps into Object Oriented Programming,
DevOps, Version Control Systems.  It was hard work; sometimes exciting and energizing, other times confusing frustrating.
It was the perfect first developer job, though.
