## How Did I Get Here?
Since I was a kid, computers always fascinated me.  The most powerful experience of this magic is a memory I have from my childhood.  My Dad had an old "PC Clone" 286 that ran MS-DOS on the venerated Intel 80286.  At some point, Dad and I went to the local software store at the mall, picked up a Game Card (*Two joystick ports!* _huzzah!_) and took it home.  That afternoon, as we lifted the case off the machine to expose it's green, copper and black guts...._my mind was blown_.  A switch was tripped inside my little mind. Seeing the little copper rivers etched into circuit boards, the mysterious black and grey microchips, the mechanical disk drive made this machine even more mysterious.  How in the world did this stuff make these digital landscapes come to life? I was mesmerized.

During my teenage years, I was riding the wave of technology that was emerging throughout the 90s: 28.8K Modem, CD-ROM drives, Intel Pentium CPUs, Windows95. My computer was a source of endless fascination.

After working as a technical staff member at a Managed Services consultancy for several years, I really enjoyed what I did every day.  
Managing customers' desktop support needs, some "beginner" Windows Server administration duties and the general grab-bag of random things that come across one's desk as Desktop Support agent,
I loved learning new things and mastering these machines that I found so fascinating.

The company I worked for allowed me to grow into larger roles and greater responsibilities. I worked with our Sales Engineering team conducting demos and presentations for some pretty cool IP the company had developed
It was a period of my career that was exciting, stressful and challenging.

As time went on, though, I started to get antsy to expand my horizons.  I thought about where I would grow from the base that I had spent years building.  As I explored what options were available to someone with my experience, I noticed a pattern: for every Telephony Engineer opening I could find, there would be ten software developer openings.  I thought that maybe I should allow myself to consider taking the plunge into developing the software that I had been merely operating for years.

There was a mental wall that I had to break through.  I never thought I could be developer; phrases like this would always immediately follow thinking about learning to build software:

* _"I'm Terrible at math..."_
* _"Coding looks so hard..."_
* _"I'll be terrible at this and probably hate it..."_

Faced with becoming more and more specialized in a role that would really limit my future options, I got to work.

I spent months weighing out the best way to re-tool my career into Software Engineering and decided to enroll in a
full-stack software engineering bootcamp program.  After several months of very hard work, I graduated and landed
my first developer role working on a marketing platform run on the LAMP Stack with an AngularJS front-end.

Thanks to a lot of guidance and support from my team I took my first steps into Object Oriented Programming,
DevOps, Version Control Systems.  It was hard work; sometimes exciting and energizing, other times confusing & frustrating.

It was the perfect start.
